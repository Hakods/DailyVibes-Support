❓ Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

Q: What is Vibe Mind?

A: Vibe Mind is your personal mindfulness partner. It helps you quickly capture your daily mood, score, and thoughts through gentle "pings," allowing you to discover patterns in your emotional well-being over time.

<hr />

Q: How does the "Vibe Coach" feature work?

A: The Vibe Coach is your personal AI assistant. You can ask it questions (e.g., "Why have I been feeling tired lately?"), and it will analyze your past mood entries and notes to provide personalized insights and reflections based only on your own data.

<hr />

Q: Where is my data stored? Is it private?

A: Your privacy is our top priority. All your entries (moods, scores, notes) are stored securely and locally on your device using Core Data. We do not have access to your personal journal entries.

When you use the optional Vibe Coach or generate AI Summaries, your (anonymized) entry data is sent securely to Firebase AI (Google) for analysis, but it is not stored permanently by the service or linked back to you.

<hr />

Q: What do I get with Vibe Mind Pro?

A: The Pro subscription unlocks the full power of the app, including:

Unlimited conversations with the AI Vibe Coach (free users have a daily limit).

Automated AI-powered Weekly and Monthly Summaries to see long-term trends.

The ability to Export all your journal entries to a CSV file for backup or personal use.

<hr />

Q: How do the daily "Pings" work?

A: The app sends you one notification (a "ping") at a random time each day between 10:00 and 22:00 (10 AM - 10 PM). This is designed to capture your mood at an authentic, unplanned moment. You have 10 minutes from the time of the ping to log your entry.

<hr />

Q: How can I report a bug or suggest a new feature?

A: The best way is to open an issue on this repository. You can also email us directly at vibemind.development@gmail.com.
